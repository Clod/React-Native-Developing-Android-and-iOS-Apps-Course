Image Loading Implementation Report
=================================

1. Asset Configuration
---------------------
a) Updated app.json:
- Added assetBundlePatterns to include image assets:
  ```json
  "assetBundlePatterns": [
    "assets/*",
    "assets/images/*"
  ]
  ```
- This ensures all images in the assets directory are bundled with the app

b) Metro Configuration:
- Created metro.config.js to handle asset resolution:
- Added support for jpg, png, and jpeg file extensions
- Configured Metro bundler to handle static assets correctly

2. Image Management Changes in FitnessWorld.js
--------------------------------------------
a) Component Changes:
- Replaced FastImage with React Native's built-in Image component
- Removed web URLs and implemented local image loading
- Simplified image source props to use local requires

b) Image Organization:
- Created a centralized imagePaths object at the top of the file
- All image imports are now managed in one location using proper relative paths
- Changed from web URLs to local require statements
- Fixed path issues by using correct relative paths ('./assets/images/')

c) Image Reference Updates:
- Popular Workout Plans:
  * Full Body Workout: Now using require('./assets/images/full_body_workout.jpg')
  * Cardio Blast: Now using require('./assets/images/cardio_blast.jpg')
  * Yoga for Flexibility: Now using require('./assets/images/yoga_flexibility.jpg')

- Intense Workout Plans:
  * Zumba Class: Now using require('./assets/images/zumba_class.jpg')
  * Circuit Training: Now using require('./assets/images/circuit_training.jpg')
  * Pilate Training: Now using require('./assets/images/pilate_training.jpg')

- Featured Training Types:
  * Strength Training: Now using require('./assets/images/strength_training.jpg')
  * Cardio: Now using require('./assets/images/cardio.jpg')
  * Yoga: Now using require('./assets/images/yoga.jpg')

3. Benefits of the New Implementation
----------------------------------
- Improved Performance: Local images load faster than remote URLs
- Offline Support: App works without internet connection
- Reduced Data Usage: No need to download images at runtime
- Better Resource Management: Images are bundled with the app
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works consistently on both iOS and Android
- Simplified Maintenance: Centralized image management makes updates easier
- Proper Asset Bundling: Images are correctly included in the app bundle

4. File Structure
---------------
All images are now stored in the assets/images/ directory:
- cardio_blast.jpg
- cardio.jpg
- circuit_training.jpg
- full_body_workout.jpg
- pilate_training.jpg
- strength_training.jpg
- yoga_flexibility.jpg
- yoga.jpg
- zumba_class.jpg

5. Important Implementation Details
--------------------------------
- Used correct relative paths starting with './' since FitnessWorld.js is in the root directory
- Configured proper asset bundling in app.json to ensure images are included in the build
- Centralized image imports in a single object for better maintenance
- Removed unnecessary FastImage properties since we're using local images
